		<br><p> Weekly composting has been suspended since May 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic forced the Department of Sanitation to scale back its operations. In late 2021, the department allowed New York City residents to request to have compost be picked up, as a way to phase curbside composting back into the lives of New Yorkers.  However, the opt-in program has failed to bring participation and collection rates back up to pre-pandemic levels. </p></br>

		<br><p>On Oct. 3, weekly curbside composting returned to Queens. All Queens residents, regardless of what type of home they are living in, received brown bins that they can fill with compost and leave out on recycling day to be collected, according to DSNY’s <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dsny/site/services/food-scraps-and-yard-waste-page/queens-composting"target=blank>website.</a></p></br>

			<br><p>“We felt that the previous iteration of curbside composting had too many obstacles: the sign up process to express interest, the sign up for the brown bin and the requirement to use a brown bin,” said Vincent Gragnani, press secretary of the Department of Sanitation. “Our Queens program eliminates all those obstacles.”</p></br>
